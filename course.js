        details: "What are Accounting Journal Entries? \n An accounting journal entry is the method used to enter an accounting transaction into the accounting records of a business. The accounting records are aggregated into the general ledger, or the journal entries may be recorded in a variety of sub-ledgers, which are later rolled up into the general ledger. This information is then used to construct financial statements as of the end of a reporting period \n Journal Entry Rules \n There must be a minimum of two line items in a journal entry, though there is no upper limit to the number of line items that can be included. A two-line journal entry is known as a simple journal entry, while one containing more line items is called a compound journal entry. The totals of the debits and credits for any transaction must always equal each other, so that an accounting transaction is always said to be If a transaction were not in balance, then it would not be possible to create financial statements.Thus, the use of debits and credits in a two- column transaction recording format is the most essential of all controls over accounting accuracy. \n Journal Entry Best Practices \n A company may use a great many journal entries in just a single reporting period, so it is better to use a larger number of simple journal entries than a smaller number of compound journal entries, in order to clarify why the entries are being made. This is useful when journal entries are being researched at a later date, and especially when they are being reviewed by auditors."

        details: "What is a general ledger? \n A general ledger is a master accounting document that includes a business’s past credit and debit transactions and serves as the foundation of the double-entry accounting system. These transactions are organized by account, like assets, liabilities, expenses, and revenue. The general ledger is important for assessing a company’s financial performance. As a business owner, you can use a general ledger to form a more accurate picture of your company’s financial standing and profitability, which may lead to better financial decisions. Many financial reports, such as cash flow statements, income statements, and balance sheets, are created using the transaction details contained in the general ledger. Let’s look at an example of a general ledger entry. Let’s say you own a marketing agency and receive a $500 payment from your client for your services. You delivered this service to your client the previous month. \n Why are general ledgers important? \n General ledgers are important when it comes to your company’s financial health because they can help you balance your books by compiling a trial balance and producing important financial statements. general ledgers help companies: \n Track financial performance and cash flow File taxes correctly Visualize every financial transaction Staying on top of your company’s accounting records isn’t the easiest task.While many small business owners use Excel to track their finances, this process is often  time- consuming and has the potential for creating accounting errors."

        details: "What is the Income Statement? \n The Income Statement is one of a company’s core financial statements that shows their profit and loss over a period of time.  The profit or loss is determined by taking all revenues and subtracting all expenses from both operating and non-operating activities. \n The income statement is one of three statements used in both corporate finance (including financial modeling) and accounting. The statement displays the company’s revenue, costs, gross profit, selling and administrative expenses, other expenses and income, taxes paid, and net profit in a coherent and logical manner. \n The statement is divided into time periods that logically follow the company’s operations. The most common periodic division is monthly (for internal reporting), although certain companies may use a thirteen-period cycle. These periodic statements are aggregated into total values for quarterly and annual results. \n This statement is a great place to begin a financial model, as it requires the least amount of information from the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Thus, in terms of information, the income statement is a predecessor to the other two core statements."

        details: "What are Financial Statements? \n Financial statements are a collection of summary-level reports about an organization's financial results, financial position, and cash flows. They include the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of cash flows. \n The Balance Sheet \n One of the financial statements is the balance sheet. It shows an entity's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity as of the report date. In this report, the total of all assets must match the combined total of all liabilities and equity. The asset information on the balance sheet is subdivided into current and long-term assets. Similarly, the liability information is subdivided into current and long-term liabilities. This stratification is useful for determining the liquidity of a business. Ideally, the total of all current liabilities should exceed the total of all current liabilities, which implies that a business has sufficient assets to pay off its current obligations. The balance sheet is also used to compare debt levels to the amount of equity invested in the business, to see if its leverage level is appropriate. \n Supplementary Notes \n When financial statements are issued to outside parties, then also include supplementary notes. These notes include explanations of various activities, additional detail on some accounts, and other items as mandated by the applicable accounting framework, such as GAAP or IFRS. The level and types of detail provided will depend on the nature of the issuing entity’s business and the types of transactions in which it engaged. A reporting entity only includes the minimum mandated amount in the supplementary notes (which can still be quite extensive), because it can be quite time-consuming to produce the disclosures."

        details: "What is the Cash Flow Statement? \n A Cash Flow Statement (also called the Statement of Cash Flows) shows how much cash is generated and used during a given time period. It is one of the main financial statements analysts use in building a three statement model. The main categories found in a cash flow statement are (1) operating activities, (2) investing activities, and (3) financing activities of a company and are organized respectively. \n The total cash provided from or used by each of the three activities is summed to arrive at the total change in cash for the period, which is then added to the opening cash balance to arrive at the cash flow statement’s bottom line, the closing cash balance. \n One of the primary reasons cash inflows and outflows are observed is to compare the cash from operations to net income. This comparison helps company management, analysts, and investors to gauge how well a company is running its operations. The cash flow statement reflects the actual amount of money the company receives from its operations. \n The reason for the difference between cash and profit is because the income statement is prepared under the accrual basis of accounting, where it matches revenues and expenses for the accounting period, even though revenues may actually not have yet been collected and expenses may not have yet been paid. In contrast, the cash flow statement only recognizes cash that has actually been received or disbursed."

        details: "Calculus \n Calculus is concerned with two basic operations, differentiation and integration, and is a tool used by engineers to determine such quantities as rates of change and areas; in fact, calculus is the mathematical ‘backbone’ for dealing with problems where variables change with time or some other reference variable and a basic understanding of calculus is essential for further study and the development of confidence in solving practical engineering problems. This will become evident in the next chapter where physical systems will be modelled and the use of ‘rates of change’ equations (called differential equations) will allow the physical system to be represented, an analysis made and a solution formed under defined conditions. This chapter is an introduction to the techniques of calculus and a consideration of some of their engineering applications. The topic continues in the next chapter with a discussion of the use of differential equations to represent physical systems and their solution for various inputs. \n Let us reiterate the results of the last two sections using more standard notation. Expressed in the starkest terms, the two fundamental operations of calculus have the objective of either (i) determining the slope of a function at a given point or (ii) determining the area under a curve. The first is the subject of differential calculus, the second, of integral calculus. \n Consider a function , which is graphed in Figure 6.3. The slope of the function at the point x can be determined by a limiting process in which a small chord through the points  and  is made to approach the tangent at . The slope of this tangent is understood to represent the slope of the function  at the point x. Its value is given by the derivative"

        details: "The basics of Geometry \n From teeny-tiny molecules in the body to jumbo jets in the air, the world is full of objects, each with its own shape. Geometry is a field of mathematics used to understand more about the lines, angles, surfaces and volumes found within our universe of objects and ideas. It can be hard to picture how something could exist without having a size. So try thinking about it this way: Each point is so small that drawing a dot to mark its place would vastly cover that point and many of its neighboring points. This means that anything that can be seen or touched is made of a community of closely nested points. \n The location of each point will be unique. To identify one, people have to assign it an address — one in a vast neighborhood of other points. Now consider a second point. To distinguish points, mathematicians often name them using capital letters. So we’ll call our two points A and B. We can pretend that point A lives at a make-believe address, like 123 Pointsville Road. We’ll give point B a made-up address of 130 Pointsville Road. And we can invent a name for their neighborhood, like Points’ Place. \n Now draw a dot atop point A. Here, saying this dot is the same thing as a point is like saying that point A is located in the Points’ Place Neighborhood (which is true) and point A is the only thing is that neighborhood (which is false)."

        details: "What is Trigonometry? \n The topic of Trigonometry is part of secondary mathematics curriculum. Trigonometry is prerequisite knowledge for learning Calculus in senior mathematics, and is essential for students who wish to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) courses. Learning Trigonometry problems requires an understanding of multiple interrelated mathematical concepts, such as algebraic transformation skills, geometry knowledge, and reasoning of graphical representation of concepts. Owing to the need to learn multiple interrelated concepts, students experience great difficulty when learning Trigonometry problems (Blackett and Tall, 1991; Kendal and Stacey, 1998). Our objective in this conceptual analysis article is to highlight the importance of scaffolding algebraic transformation skills to facilitate the initial phase of learning Trigonometry problems. The main focus here is to calculate the unknown side of a right-angled triangle from a known side and an angle, which can pose a challenge for many students. More specifically, we contend that some students may have difficulties when solving sin30° = x/5, say, despite having learned how to solve a similar problem, such as x/4 = 3. For more challenging Trigonometry problems, such as sin30° = 12/x where the pronumeral is a denominator, students have been taught to “swap” the x with sin30° and then from this, solve for x (Source: personal communication). \n We argue that such teaching strategy, as detailed, for Trigonometry problems falls short of addressing the algebraic transformation skills, which are required to solve Trigonometry problems. It does not, for example, attempt to relate a student’s prior knowledge of solving linear equations with a fraction to the solving of Trigonometry problems. Apart from this, students may experience great difficulty when they attempt to distinguish the difference between two types of Trigonometry problems that look similar, but yet are conceptually different from each other, consequently because of the relative position of the pronumeral (i.e., a numerator vs. a denominator) (Kendal and Stacey, 1998). On this basis, it is important for educators to consider different theoretical approaches, pedagogical strategies, and/or educational programs that could help students acquire relevant skills to solve Trigonometry problems that differ in terms of the location of the pronumeral (i.e., a numerator vs. a denominator). One possibility, for example, is related to the use of different, but comparable learning theories that could facilitate effective learning and inform meaningful understanding. The aim of this article then, situated within the context of the topical theme of Trigonometry, is for us to examine the effectiveness of two learning theories: learning by analogy and learning by comparison. This analysis, we contend, could form the basis for further research development, theoretically, empirically, conceptually, and/or methodologically, into the effective application of different learning theories."

As an essential ingredient in a quantum network, quantum routers can be used to transfer the quantum information from one channel to others, distributing it in the network. Due to their fastness, very low loss and long-playing coherence [2–4], photons are considered as ideal candidates of carriers of quantum information and thus quantum routing of photons has drawn more attentions in recent years. Numerous theoretical and experimental researches on quantum routing or photon transport have been made based on several different structures, such as coupled-resonator waveguides [5–16], whispering-gallery-mode resonators [17–20], waveguide-emitter systems [21–29], superconducting circuit [30–36]. \n Recently, giant atoms, as an emerging playground in quantum optics, have attracted a plethora of research interest because they exhibit several striking new phenomena, such as frequency-dependent relaxation rate and Lamb shift [37,38], oscillating bound states [39–43], decoherence-free interaction [44–46], chiral quantum optics [47,48], and phase-controlled frequency conversions [49,50]. For a traditional small atom, the size of the atom is very smaller than the wavelength of the field, and thus it can be well described with the dipole approximation. However, a giant atom couples to a waveguide at multiple points, and the distance between these points is no longer negligible compared with the waveguides of propagating fields in the waveguide. Such a giant-atom structure can be realized in several systems, such as superconducting quits coupled to either surface acoustic waves [51–54] or microwave transmission lines [4,44,55–57], cold atoms interacting with optical lattices [58]. In the giant-atom setup, the multiple coupling points lead to additional interference effects that are not present in quantum optics with conventional small atoms [37,39,45,59,60]."

Units are important as they standardize everything not only across the different branches of physics but in different countries as well. There are several systems of units for basis quantities in physics, with the most popular being the modern metric system of SI units and the American (or United States Customary - USC) system adapted from British Imperial units. In the following article, we will go through the different systems and the base units that make up all the different units in physics. \n As a US high school student, you probably need to know how to convert between metric and USC units. Knowing how to convert between units and perform dimensional analysis is also extremely useful for checking whether your working to a problem checks out. It can assist you if you can't quite remember a formula, as an equation must be dimensionally consistent. Universal constants in physics can have quite complicated and difficult to conceptualize units. But they can help you remember a formula when the constants are provided for you in a test or exam, but not the formulae! If you need to use Newton's Law of Gravitation, recall it contains the gravitational constant,  which has units . This reminds us that there were the product of two masses in the numerator, and that this equation obeys the inverse square law and therefore we have  in the denominator."

The force on a current-carrying wire due to the electrons which move within it when a magnetic field is present is a classic example. This process also works in reverse. Either moving a wire through a magnetic field or (equivalently) changing the strength of the magnetic field over time can cause a current to flow. \n Faraday's law, due to 19ᵗʰ century physicist Michael Faraday. This relates the rate of change of magnetic flux through a loop to the magnitude of the electro-motive force \ mathcal{E}EE induced in the loop. The relationship is \n Faraday's experiment : Induction from a magnet moving through a coil \n The key experiment which lead Michael Faraday to determine Faraday's law was quite simple. It can be quite easily replicated with little more than household materials. Faraday used a cardboard tube with insulated wire wrapped around it to form a coil. A voltmeter was connected across the coil and the induced EMF read as a magnet was passed through the coil. The setup is shown in Figure 2. \n These observations are consistent with Faraday's law. Although the stationary magnet might produce a large magnetic field, no EMF can be induced because the flux through the coil is not changing. When the magnet moves closer to the coil the flux rapidly increases until the magnet is inside the coil. As it passes through the coil the magnetic flux through the coil begins to decrease. Consequently, the induced EMF is reversed."
